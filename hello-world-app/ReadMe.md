# React Monolith Samples / Hello World App

A sample application built with the React Monolith framework that demonstrates:

- Common **folder structure setup** ;
- **Fastify Server** initialisation (through factory function) + configuration ;
- **JSX declarative routing** ;
- Custom request **Controllers** ;
- Defining **Views** ;
- Defining isomorphic **Islands** that _first renders on the server_ then gets
  revived as a _client-side interactive_ isolated React root node ;
- and even **internal errors handling**!
